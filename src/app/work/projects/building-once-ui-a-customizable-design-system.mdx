## Overview

As part of the founding team at Reneazy, I designed and developed the entire website from scratch, focusing on modern design practices and user-centric principles. The project aimed to create a seamless experience for users navigating the complexities of home renovation.

## Design Challenge

The renovation industry often struggles with trust issues, which can deter potential customers. Our challenge was to create a digital experience that immediately builds credibility and simplifies the renovation journey for homeowners.

### User Research Insights

Through surveys, we identified three critical pain points among users:

- Lack of transparency in renovation costs
- Concerns about workmanship quality
- Anxiety regarding contractor reliability

These insights informed our design approach and influenced every decision made throughout the project.

## Design Process

### Brand Identity Evolution

**Before:** The initial design featured a simple typewriter text on a blue background based on the founder's instructions. While functional, it lacked visual impact.

**After:** The redesigned website incorporated:

- A modern green logo symbolizing trust and sustainability.
- A strategic color palette transitioning from light green to dark theme, enhancing brand visibility.
- A cohesive visual language that balances professionalism with creativity.

### Typography Strategy

Typography choices were made with user experience in mind:

- **CalSans SemiBold** for headings: Creates bold statements that instill trust.
- **Calligraphy font** for the "Curated For You" section: Adds an artistic touch.
- **Sans-serif font** for body text: Ensures readability in long-form content.

### User Interface Design

#### Trust-Building Hero Section

The hero section was crafted to establish credibility instantly:

- Prominently displays "27+ years of experience" to build immediate trust.
- Features a custom Tailwind CSS animation revealing "Curated For You" with a paint roller effect.
- Includes a bold CTA directly beneath the value proposition for clear user direction.

#### User Journey Mapping

I mapped the user journey to create a conversion-focused structure:

1. **Hero section** with clear USP and CTA
2. **Social proof** displaying partner logos to build trust
3. **Problem acknowledgment** section validating user concerns
4. **Solution presentation** addressing these concerns
5. **Process explanation** using a simple three-step format for clarity

### Accessibility & Inclusivity

The portfolio section was intentionally designed without text, using only images to ensure accessibility for users of all ages and technical backgrounds—removing potential friction points in the customer journey.

### Component Design System

I implemented a cohesive design system utilizing:

- **Aceternity UI components**: Modified the GitHub globe with green lines to maintain brand identity.
- **Magic UI elements**: Incorporated interactive discount scratch components for partner referral pages.
- **Shadcn components**: Utilized for consistent UI patterns throughout the site.

## Technical Implementation

The design vision was brought to life using:

- **Next.js & TypeScript**: For a robust, type-safe development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient styling and animations, including signature effects.
- **Responsive design principles**: Ensuring seamless experiences across all devices.
- **Performance optimization**: Achieving 95+ Lighthouse scores and real-world speed analytics scores of 95+ on Vercel.

## User-Centered Features

### Problem-Solution Framework

I designed a UI that directly addresses user concerns:

- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear visual hierarchy emphasizes this benefit to alleviate cost anxiety.
- **Exceptional Craftsmanship**: Visual elements highlight quality workmanship.
- **Reliable Contractors**: Design elements reinforce professionalism and reliability.

### Interactive Elements

- **Partner discount reveal**: Implemented an interactive scratch component that gamifies the discount discovery process.
- **Crisp chatbot integration**: Designed a non-intrusive chat interface to collect visitor information while providing immediate assistance.

## Results & Impact

The redesigned website has:

- Improved user engagement through strategic UI patterns.
- Enhanced brand perception through consistent visual language.
- Streamlined customer journeys with intuitive navigation.
- Achieved 95+ Lighthouse performance scores while maintaining visual sophistication.

## Design Decisions Impact

### Color Psychology

The transition from light green to dark theme was deliberate:

- Creates visual interest and guides users through their journey.
- Emphasize the brand's neon green in the dark sections for maximum impact
- Establish a sense of trust and reliability associated with the green color palette

### Visual Hierarchy

Each section was designed with careful attention to visual hierarchy:

- Primary CTAs stand out with distinctive styling

- The most important information (partner experience, service benefits) receives visual priority

- Secondary information is accessible but doesn't compete with key conversion elements

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies my holistic approach to UI/UX design—combining research insights, visual design principles, and technical implementation to create a cohesive user experience. By addressing specific user pain points through thoughtful design, the Reneazy website not only looks impressive but effectively serves its business goals while providing genuine value to users.
