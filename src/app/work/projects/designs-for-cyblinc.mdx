## Overview

During my internship as a **UI/UX Designer and Front-End Developer** at CYBLINC, I designed and developed multiple landing pages for a tech services company. The goal was to create clean, user-centric wireframes that align with the company's vision while adhering to modern design principles.

## Design Objectives

- **Minimal Design**: Created landing pages with no-scroll layouts to ensure simplicity and ease of navigation.
- **Three-Color Palette**: Implemented a cohesive color scheme to reflect the brand's identity.

## Key Contributions

1. **Wireframe Creation**:

   - Designed intuitive wireframes that prioritize user engagement and seamless navigation.
   - Focused on structuring content to highlight key services and value propositions.

2. **Responsive Design**:

   - Ensured compatibility across devices using responsive design principles.
   - Maintained visual consistency and accessibility for all users.

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Developed the landing pages using modern tools like Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
   - Optimized layouts for performance while preserving design integrity.

## Visual Showcase

Below are the landing pages I designed during this project(The last one ended up being the official page):
